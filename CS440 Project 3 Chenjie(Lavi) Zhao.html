<h2> Problem Definition </h2>
<p>
  The goal of this project is to implement an algorithm to win a 4x4x4 tic-ta-toe game 
  using minimax and alpha-beta pruning technique. Minimax algorithm needs to be implemented 
  to provide the next move and alpha-beta pruning is implemented to reduce the game tree or 
  search time. This project illustrates how minimax algorithm applies to a real life situation.
</p>
<p>
  I assumed the rules the AI has to follow, in the order of importance, are:
</p>
<p>
  “Rule 1: If the maximizing player has a winning move, take it.
</p>
<p>
  Rule 2: If the minimizing player has a winning move, block it.
</p>
<p>
  Rule 3: If the maximizing player can create two winning lines after this move, do it.”
</p>
<p>
  The anticipated difficulty is figuring out a correct way to evaluate the board and set 
  all the heuristic values for the game tree so that the algorithm will do exactly what the rules above dictates.

<h2> Method and Implementation </h2>
<p>
  I followed the pseudocode below from wikipedia to implement my minimax function.

</p>

<p>
  The main back bone of my algorithm is minimax, evaluate and myAIAlgorithm functions in aiTicTacToe.java. 
  myAIAlgorithm function helps generate a calculated next move using minimax function. 
  In the minimax function, I implemented the recursive minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. 
  In the evaluate function, I specified the score system for a node in the game tree.
</p>
<p>
  The score evaluation scheme is as follows:
</p>

</p>
<p>
  Other minor helper functions included:
  <ul>
    <li>isEnded: Check the board to see if there's a win or a draw.</li>
    <li>generateAllMoves: Generate a list of available positions on the current board.</li>
    <li>initializeWinningLines: Find all 76 winning lines and put them in a list.</li>
    <li>myRandomAlgorithm: Generate random next moves.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h2>Experiments</h2>
<h3>Experiment 1: AI vs. Random Move Generator</h3>
<p> 
  I modified the runTicTacToe class so that player 1 uses the AI algorithm I implemented with depth = 2 and player 
  2 uses the random move generator that was provided to us in the skeleton code. Which player goes first is randomized. 
  I repeated the game loop for 1000 times for each trial. I then evaluated the winning rates and efficiency 
  for making a decision of player 1 under 3 trials. (Depth = 2 is used because it is sufficient enough to beat the random 
  generator and uses significantly less time to make a decision)
</p>
<h3>Experiment 2: AI vs. AI under different depth and same heuristic function</h3>
<p>
  Both players use the AI algorithm I implemented. Player 1 calls minimax with depth = 3 and for player 2, depth = 2. 
  Which player goes first is randomized. I repeated the game loop for 100 times for each trial. 
  I then evaluated the winning rates of player 1 and efficiency of decision making under 3 trials.

<h2> Discussion </h2>
<p>
From the experiment results, we can see that the method is very successful competing a random move generator as expected. On average, the algorithm with a depth of 2 was 
sufficient to beat the random generator within 10 moves. The algorithm is successful competing against a version of itself with less depth as well. As 
we can see that the competition always results in a first player win as expected, since the first player always does a deeper search than the second player.
</p>
<p> 
Strengths:
<ul>
<li>Uses alpha-beta pruning to optimize running time</li>
<li>Great performance against random move generators</li>
</ul> </p>

<p> 
Weaknesses:
<ul>
<li>Very static response for a specific board</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p> 
Future Work:
<ul>
<li>Improve the algorithm so it detects potential fork(multiple winning line) in future moves</li>
<li>Experiment with more different heuristic values and depths to find the perfect combination</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2> Conclusions </h2>

<p>
Game theory can be a substantial part of AI development. In this programming assignment, we experimented with minimax algorithm using alpha-beta 
pruning. As we can see, with a depth of 2, the algorithm is already very successful with random move generator. However, more work can be done for it to 
compete with another algorithm, such as experiment with more different heuristic values and depths to find the perfect combination.
